Simple Shopping Cart, ideal for use with Django.

Cart takes any generic product - could be a Django model, could be anything.
The product must have two attributes at the very least:

*	product_id (integer)
*	price (float/integer)

class Product(object):
    def __init__(self, product_id, price):
        self.product_id = int(product_id)
        self.price = price
